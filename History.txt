* 1 minor bug fix
  * Fixed file redirection for Java executor since sh doesn't support &>.

== 0.3.2 2009-02-16

    a default if not specified.

  * Java compiler redirects standard error to a file.

* 2 major enhancements:
  * Generates a very useful HTML report, complete with side-by-side diffs.
